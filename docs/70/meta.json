 "abstract": "Living in Toronto without legal status goes along with many disadvantages and problems in daily life. Local initiatives have been fighting against these circumstances since the 1980s. 2004, a Don’t Ask Don’t Tell-Policy was implemented. In 2013, Toronto’s status as a Sanctuary City was legally codified. The poster explains the historical formation of Sanctuary Cities, details relevant policies and barriers to implementation in the city of Toronto.",
