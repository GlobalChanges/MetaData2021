 "title": "Say no to pollution and yes to solution. The Ocean Cleanup",
 "abstract": "Presently, over five trillion pieces of plastic litter the ocean. Not only is it damaging the marine life, but can also cause serious problems for humans. The Ocean Cleanup removes plastic from bodies of water since 2014. First, they focused on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, but research showed that the most plastic in oceans comes from rivers. They built interceptors to collect plastic waste from rivers in Malaysia, Indonesia, Dominican Republic and Vietnam. The goal is to remove plastic from 1000 rivers in five years. If their technology works properly for a long time, then by 2040 90% of plastic waste could be removed in all oceans.",
