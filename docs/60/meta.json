 "title": "Water conflicts – The Water-society relation from the perspective of political ecology",
 "abstract": "Water is more than just a natural resource. Its materialities and discourses are intrinsically intertwined with continually changing social processes. In a world that is increasingly influenced by anthropogenic actions, this hybrid character leads to conflicts over and because of water. This poster analyzes the connections and interdependencies between water and society. For this, the social character of water as well as central approaches of Political ecology are shown and ultimately connected to the phenomenon of water conflicts. It is then presented what drivers lead to water conflicts, how they can be classified and which alternative solutions of governing water emerge from conflicts.",
